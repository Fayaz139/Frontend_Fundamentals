# Objects and Arrays – JavaScript Practice

This directory contains my practice work for **JavaScript Objects and Arrays**.  
The purpose of this folder is to clearly understand core concepts, solve problems correctly, and then explore **better or more efficient approaches**.

---

## Folder Structure

```
Objects and Arrays
│
├── problems
├── experiments (Efficient approach)
└── README.md
```

---

## 📁 problems

- Contains **correct and straightforward solutions** to given problems.
- Focuses on:
  - Understanding the problem statement
  - Writing clear and readable code
  - Producing the expected output
- These solutions are considered **my go to approach without any hard thinking**.

This folder is mainly used for:
- Concept revision
- Assignments
- Reference solutions

---

## 📁 experiments

- Contains **alternative, optimized, or more efficient approaches** to the same problems.
- Used for:
  - Trying different looping techniques (`for`, `for...in`, `for...of`)
  - Writing cleaner or more idiomatic JavaScript
  - Improving logic and performance
- This folder is meant for **learning and experimentation**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Structure

- Keep correct solutions and experiments separate
- Encourage better problem-solving and optimization skills
- Make revision easier
- Follow a developer-style learning workflow

---

## 🛠 Topics Covered

- Objects
- Arrays
- Loops
- Object methods
- Problem-solving patterns
- Basic optimization techniques

---

## ✅ Note

Both folders are important:
- `problems` → correctness
- `experiments (Efficient approach)` → improvement

This structure helps in building **strong JavaScript fundamentals**.

<!-- Object.fromEntries(arr) = converts array to object -->
<!-- Object.Entries(obj) = converts object to array -->

<!-- "for in" loop = to get direct values in object without indexes -->
<!-- "for of" loop = to get direct values in array without indexes -->
